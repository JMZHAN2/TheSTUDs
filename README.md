Proposal:

The core objective of the Study Map project is to develop a platform that helps students track and visualize their study habits. The Minimum Viable Product (MVP) will focus on several key features, including a login system that allows users to securely access their study data and set weekly study goals. Users will be able to pause these goals when necessary, and a study timer will track the time spent on each session. A central feature of the platform is the interactive study map, which uses geolocation to visually represent where users study most frequently. Additionally, users will have the option to share their study analytics with others, promoting accountability and social engagement. In later stages, stretch goals such as social media integration, site-blocking tools for improved focus, positive or negative reinforcement based on performance, and the creation of study groups may be implemented to further enhance user experience. Together, these features will provide users with a comprehensive tool for visualizing their study efforts and motivating them to improve their consistency and productivity.
